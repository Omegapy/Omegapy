Hello World,

- 👋 
I am a computer science student at LCCC; I am a non-typical student; I am 51 years old… 👴
I have been coding as a hobby for several years; I am a coding enthusiast. I also aspire to become a software engineer, 
get a job in that field and/or engineer my own software.
🔧 I have been a Kyocera field technician for 15 years.

- 👀
I am interested in software engineering, algorithms, machine learning/AI, video games, 
and all things that are related to coding.

- 🌱
I am currently learning c++, and the Raylib library (Raylib.com)

- 💞️
I would love to collaborate on a project; my goal is to build up my GitHub account, 
get proficient in a coding language, and be accepted as a collaborator on a project.
